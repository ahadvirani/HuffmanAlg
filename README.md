# HuffmanAlg

COP 3530

Implement Huffmans algorithm.

This program will:
-read a file
-calculate the frequency of each character in the file
-place the characters and frequencies into a table indexed by the character
-run the character frequency through Huffmans Algorithm and create a Huffman Tree
    https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/Everything/html/Huffman.html
    This site gives code for BuildTree (algorithm) HuffTree (object) and HuffLeaf that would work for this.
    This code is used and referenced in the project file.
-traverse the Huffman Tree and print out the characters and frequencies
-read a file and encode the characters in the file using a Huffman Tree
-decode a string of 1s and 0s using a Huffman Tree
